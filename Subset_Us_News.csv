"In regard to ""Envisioning I-70 as a toll road"" (Jan 18), I was troubled by the cost of the toll road to motorists. Ten to fifteen cents per mile is insane. Even more troubling is the tripling of the cost to our trucking companies. Did the Missouri Department of Transportation take into consideration the amount of students who travel back and forth to the several universities on the I-70 corridor between St. Louis and Kansas City? As the parent of a student at the University of Missouri in Columbia, I know my child does not have the means to pay $30.00 every time he makes a 200 mile round trip from our home in St. Charles to the university. Did the Transportation Dept. take into consideration the cost to the small towns along this route who will ultimately suffer if this toll road comes to fruition? Motorists will not be able to afford the extra cost of visiting these small communities that depend on consumers for their livelihood. Towns, such as Hermann and Fulton, who depend on the tourism trade will be adversely affected. The overall cost to these communities, as well as the state itself, will be enormous. Motorists from our state, as well as others, might decide the cost of the toll roads far outweigh the desire to visit our state for the many amenities we provide. The Lake of the Ozarks and all of the towns along the way will lose many tourists to other recreational sites in other states. Carlyle Lake in Illinois and Rend Lake in Kentucky come to mind as areas that are in close proximity to the St. Louis area and offer many of the same recreational amenities that are available at the Lake of the Ozarks."

The pawns in their odd, extended game are several sweet, young innocents who struggle to uncover their own destinies just like Harry and his friends. And the drama takes place among an interesting assortment of characters populating the Cirque des Rêves, which does seem, a little, like Hogwarts."
"Heat the oven to 500 degrees. Lightly oil a baking sheet. In a small bowl, stir together the ricotta, honey, orange zest and cinnamon."
"The obvious reason that the artistic logic of making the best product possible is largely ignored is money.

"But the action is clear and swiftly paced, and the large ensemble does well by both the play’s poetic language and its intense physical demands — one character is killed in a mechanical chair, another starves herself to death and a third robotically continues dancing when hearing that her loved ones are dead. Among the standouts are Andrew Weems’ Bassanes — barking out such lines as, “Hold your chops, nightmare!” and “Furies whip thee!” with entertaining gusto — and Boras, heartbreaking as the doomed bride."
"Arrive early. Difficult airport parking, long lines at security checkpoints and the possibility of the airline overselling the flight and bumping passengers should all be considered when deciding what time to arrive at the airport. Give yourself plenty of extra time."

Never pour an accelerant such as lighter fluid or gasoline on the grill."
"Vanttinen's attempts to take down the Team StrongStyle fighter, one of four on the card from trainer Marcus Marinelli's Independence gym, were ineffective.

"Mr. Blackwell of Arkansas uses different iconic Southern fixtures as his models, but his homes stand out starkly from their neighbors. His $450,000 Keenan Tower House, the ""trailer on a stick,"" is 80 feet tall and very narrow. It starts out as wood, to relate to surrounding trees, and then turns into white metal at the top as a nod to the clouds in the sky. Mr. Blackwell says his work isn't so foreign that locals can't relate to it. ""They see it and think it looks strangely familiar,"" he says."
"""After a while, I just said I'm not coming out,"" she said. ""I told them this is not a client."""

"Like a skilled batter fouling off pitch after pitch, Novitzky made Hardin work hard out there, standing in the middle of the courtroom for hours on end.

"But by and large, the team hasn't had much luck in the lottery proper or with the players it has drafted as a result. Only once has it actually improved its position, and that was more of technicality. In 2003, Cleveland and Denver tied with the worst records in the league, 17-65, and in a drawing to determine which team would draft first should neither earn one of the top three spots, Denver finished first and Cleveland second. So, technically, the Cavs moved up one spot by winning the lottery."
"Full of rich performances and tricky narrative flourishes, the movie caught the attention of critics and studios, too."
"Though corn and beans are better-known Mexican natives, squash predates them by several thousand years; Maya people domesticated several varieties of squash as early as 8000 B.C. Oils from these seeds were the main source of dietary fat before the Spanish introduced beef and pork. Though the native plants included cucumber, zucchini, patty pan and butternut squash, great quantities of pumpkin — la calabaza grande — defines the Yucatán diet even today. Toasted, ground pumpkin seeds still appear on menus even more than the flesh."

But that was before the financial crisis hit."
"Osborne said that Lyerla still has trouble lining up correctly sometimes, but he seems to be catching on fairly quickly, though his stats are somewhat deceiving: All three of his receptions might have gone for touchdowns, but it’s come against inferior competition in Nevada and Missouri State.

"1006 CARPATHIAN DR $90,000"

"""In back-to-backs, I can feel more soreness than usual,"" he said. ""But it has progressed; it feels a lot better than it did."""
"The West Portal strip has plenty of grown-up attractions - in the form of friendly neighborhood pubs. And they all have quintessential bar names: The Dubliner, Joxer Daly's and perhaps best of all, the Philosopher's Club. The closest you'll get to mixology in West Portal is a gin and tonic. And in this case, that's a very good thing."
"2009 Rock Wall Stagecoach Vineyard Napa Valley Zinfandel ($40, 15.8%): Kent Rosenblum and daughter Shauna certainly know the style their partisans love. Here they've tapped the rocky Stagecoach site for a no-holds-barred expression. Intense, lusty cinnamon wood notes, with blackberry jam and a sweet licorice tone. Not subtle, but rewarding. As one taster put it, ""This is the wine that will make you do something stupid."" Hope not."

"A The lanes have not been narrowed and are the standard 12 feet wide.

"In some small ones, families were watching TV, as if the pavilions were open-air living rooms. In the largest ones, men were sitting as still as cross-legged statues, one at the base of each pillar. A church service, perhaps? But we were passing dozens of churches. A ceremony, then?"
"Cleveland United 2, Oak Ridges Knights 0"
"Take Barbara Updegraff, 80, a Republican retiree who lives in Palm Harbor and participated in the poll."
"A That certainly I have done on purpose. I like records that have kind of a homemade feel about them so you can hear the human beings at work on them. I think it makes the general public quite nervous. The other reason is that a lot of people who listen to my records are people in the business -- other musicians and producers and people like that. They never buy my records; they get them free. But the payback is I can pick up a cover song if I don't overpolish my stuff. That's how I make my living, is people cover my songs."

"Don't get me wrong: I still miss Dad every day. But I believe that when I stood at the top of Conners, Dad's spirit enveloped me at a place I know he would have loved. From that point on, I was able to carry on with my own life's journey, bringing Dad's spirit with me in the best way possible."

Big flavors in the accompanying cheddar-jalapeno grits, studded with bits of house-made bacon, finished off a winning combination."

"After months of talks, negotiators for five major banks, the Obama administration and most state attorneys general are poised to settle claims stemming from a probe of ""robo-signing"" — the banks' widespread practice of rubber-stamping some of the paperwork involved in a foreclosure. It's a settlement, so by its nature neither side gets everything it wanted out of the deal. But it offers relief now and in the near future for millions of borrowers, and the precedent it sets for loan modifications could help millions more. That's why California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, who's been reluctant to sign on, should do so."

In his interviews and his essays, he's always seemed both grumpy and indecisive, a person who knows how he's coming across and still can't quite help it. That Harper's essay, for example, ends on a mildly optimistic note, but its most memorable lines arrive much earlier, when Franzen is savaging America's politics and pop culture. His best essays don't offer final thoughts so much as they reveal the process of thinking. It's what makes them so good - and so easy to argue with."

When summer rolls in and the season renews at Ravinia (about a quarter mile away), this place is even more popular, though sidewalk tables at least boost capacity some. Recommended: Fennel-crusted scallops, Moroccan-spiced whitefish, duck with corn-ricotta ravioli, sticky toffee cake. Open: Dinner Tuesday-Saturday, lunch Tuesday-Friday. Entree prices: $11-$21. Credit cards: DC, DS, M, V. Reservations: Accepted from 5 to 6 p.m. only. Noise: Conversation-challenged. Other: Wheelchair accessible."

"Pedigree: Wheat fans rejoice, this is a good one. Very wheaty, with a hint of spice (orange? cinnamon?) and low in alcohol (4.8 percent). Its old-style brewing technique does not involve the usual, giant vertical cylinders you see in brewpubs, but rather a more open process. And don't worry about that sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Even those who don't like wheat should give this a try. It's not overpowering and, like some hoppy ales that can turn off non-ale drinkers, this may pique the interest of wheat novices (like myself). I first tasted wheat beer in the early '90s, and it's still not my cup of tea, er, brew. But this cloudy beer beckoned me to try another. (By the way, in German ""keller"" means ""cellar"" and ""hefe"" means ""yeast."")"

"But the president has it all wrong. Indeed, speculation cannot be responsible for the steady upward trend in oil prices — a price spike here or a spike there, perhaps. Recent trading in natural-gas futures is a useful illustration. The majority of natural-gas futures recently traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange have been held by speculators. Natural-gas prices, however, are at 10-year lows. Why the discrepancy? Due to enhanced drilling technology, supplies of natural gas have skyrocketed. Speculators in an oil-price benchmark, however, have held less than 50 percent of the futures traded on the NYMEX, and oil prices continue to climb. The lesson: With abundant supply, prices drop, and speculation does not materially affect prices."

Mel Katz is not shy about expressing his opinion on art and culture and the petty rules and regulations that stifle the human spirit. What they don't like -- what Vera Katz particularly doesn't like -- is to talk about a difficult childhood that included an escape out of Nazi-occupied France during World War II or a struggle with a rare form of cancer that almost killed in her last year as mayor.

"There is a cure against racism. The deep wounds can be healed. But the healing process is intricate, deliberate and will require involvement from those who have previously remained silent. When racism raises its ugly head, silence becomes toxic and our apathy is interpreted as total acceptance. We always have a choice: do nothing and let racism go uncontested and flourish, or do something -- act up, rise up and speak up. We must pick up the armor of righteousness daily in order to slay the evil forces of racism at work against us. It will not be easy and it will not always be comfortable for any of us, but courage is a game changer. We must each take a step, each day, to garner support and find our voice as the moral majority. Here are 10 steps we can each take to step out of the shadows of silence:"

He could be a regular for the Cardinals if Pujols' jumps town. He could be on the bench if Pujols returns. He could be traded if the right offer comes along and the Cardinals want to pounce on a starting shortstop, for example."

"In ""Prague Winter,"" her compelling new memoir, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright emphasizes the importance of leadership -- or its lack -- in world affairs. As a woman, she is the Czechoslovakian-born daughter of Josef Korbel and Anna Spiegelova. As a diplomat, she is a daughter of Munich, the infamous agreement that turned part of her country over to Nazi Germany.

There were plenty of Santa hats, suspenders and spandex skivvies to gawk at. Fundraising for the Ethiopia Project, the Santa Speedo 5K down Northwest 23rd Avenue, raised about $1,600 for the Portland nonprofit this month. With just 50 or so runners, that amount would not have been possible without a slew of unpaid volunteers and a large donation of beer from Deschutes Brewery. The Ethiopia Project gathers shoes to create recreational opportunities in Ethiopia. It also is working to help villages get clean water and build new schools.

"When it comes to the different understandings of atonement embraced by our church, we can journey with each of them in prayer and worship without feeling ourselves torn asunder or compromised by their different emphases. It is possible to see in them all the same basic premise: that ""earth and heaven are joined and man is reconciled to God"" (as the Exsultet puts it!). Bickering over and then deciding finally exactly how that happens is less important than standing firm in our awed confession that in fact it has happened and is continuing to happen. The Anglican tradition rejoices in the great mysteries of our faith, not using ""mystery"" as an excuse for ignorance or indecision, but recognizing that all of our attempts to explain how God does what God does are going to be partial and incomplete."

"øDrawing from actual events in Van Gogh's life, Laurence Anholt's book weaves a story about how a little boy named Camille befriends the artist. Camille and his family appeared in paintings created by Van Gogh. This interactive story reveals how, although Van Gogh painted vibrant paintings of the village people and its surroundings, the townspeople of Camille's village thought the painter was odd and ostracized him. But Camille and his family accepted Van Gogh and saw the genius of his work. The book contains 19 puzzles which kids play to bring the characters within the book to life. By tapping illustrations of characters, kids can activate a mode that lets them see the gears and mechanisms that would make the character move. By tapping again on the character, the mechanisms spring apart so that kids can connect them once again. When they do, the character will now appear to animate in the story. Kids can also use simple art tools to repaint the characters so that they appear on the pages how they would like them to look. With soothing background music and the ability to be transported to a museum for closer inspection of Van Gogh's work, this is a great way for kids to learn about this artist and 10 of his famous paintings."

"One would assume that Holmgren and Heckert will not again follow the same pattern of inactivity. After all, trying again in 2012 with the 2011 cast will likely produce the same results. It's obvious that the Browns need to add at least one wide receiver; focusing on both an outside threat and a slot receiver. If such a strategy seems appropriate, then a combination of Jackson and Amendola makes sense. Jackson would instantly become the lone Browns' talent that would cause an opposing defense anxiety, while Amendola could benefit from the continual underneath dump offs that are a staple of Shurmur's offense. Additionally, both players have Cleveland ties. Jackson was drafted by a front office that included Heckert and Amendola was formerly coached by Shurmur."

And better yet, that same team is also lacking picks in the third and sixth rounds because of trades with the Jets and Packers. The Saints have only their first-round pick, two fourths and a seventh. Not good for a team that could really use extra picks to continue to build around their core of players."

Tax experts say it is therefore reasonable to expect that most of Apple's profits would be American as well.

"When this editorial board laid out its cornerstone principles for reform back in 2009, at the top of the list was universal participation -- what critics call a mandate. Requiring everyone to have coverage addresses the current inequality that forces people with insurance to pay the bills of those without. 'Health care is not a commodity, as some Issue 3 proponents maintain, that people can choose or not choose to use. Sooner or later, everyone needs medical attention. As health reforms continue to evolve, slamming doors at the state level is bad public policy."
"This is a devastating portrait. At times, the U.S. health care system delivers the worst of both worlds: pay more, get less. Unfortunately, the message isn't new. America's fragmented and overspecialized health system maximizes returns to providers -- doctors, hospitals, drug companies -- but not to society. Fee-for-service reimbursement allows providers to reconcile their ethical duty (more care for patients) and economic self-interest (higher incomes). The more they do, the more they earn. Restraints are few, because patients and providers both resist limits on their choices. Government regulators and private insurers are too weak to control costs."

"Turns out that was just a taste of the drama to come for the Blazers (20-23), who fell to 1-4 on a seven-game trip that has been a disaster. The Blazers managed just 12 points and five field goals in the first quarter and trailed 55-29 at halftime. At that point, it was fair to wonder if the Blazers would finish with more turnovers than field goals, because they had 17 turnovers and 11 made shots.

This is a European renaissance. DePersio brings French techniques to Italian food, and the result is something elemental and transcendent, with a gnocchi, for example, that seems to defy the laws of physics.

"_ ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990): Burton and Depp's first film together and one that still strikes a wistful, poignant tone after all this time. I still can't decide whether this fairy tale is sweetly dark or darkly sweet. Either way, Depp is delicate and lovely as the misunderstood title character, the creation of an inventor who died before his work was complete, leaving Edward to fend for himself in the outside world with scissors for hands. While many initially fear him as a monster, he's actually a gentle creature who falls hopelessly in love with Winona Ryder's idealized, fair-haired teenager. Burton's candy-colored vision of suburbia finds just the right satirical tone, and the ending gets me every time."

"At about the 32, safety Avery Patterson had Mariota cold but clearly slowed up and lazily stuck out an arm as Mariota zipped past him. What should have been a 10-yard gain ended up being an 82-yard phantom touchdown run. Even if Mariota had broken a true tackle attempt or even cut back against Patterson, any extra move or hit would have allowed pursuit to catch Mariota. Instead, he ran untouched for a touchdown."

"The onetime boy wonder -- all of 14 when he signed on as vocalist for the Spencer Davis Group -- will turn 64 on Saturday. But you'll still find a raw ebullience in the vocals as Winwood tackles a career catalog versatile enough to include the garage-y R&B of ""Gimme Some Lovin' "" alongside the synth-sweetened polish of ""Higher Love."" Opening is fellow Englishman Bobby Long. 6:30 p.m., the Fillmore Detroit, 2115 Woodward, Detroit. 313-961-5450. $29.50."

"Unless you're cruising Prince William Sound or the Weddell Sea, it's likely you'll run into beaches and snorkeling trips. So how do you keep valuables (including watch, ID and ship-board card key) safe while in the water? The Wet Safe by Design Go is a fanny pack built like a diver's dry bag, including the same roll construction and a zip-like seal. It's big enough to hold a wallet, a cell phone and an iPod, but that's a lot of gear to trust to a rubber bag. In a bathtub test, it kept my cell phone dry after 20 minutes submerged."
"Batchelder was introducing Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum when he cracked a joke about whether Obama, a Democrat, should be re-elected."
"øThis season we have been on top of the East most of the year, but not without the plague of injuries that has hit every other team. Looking back, having five new players and having a starting point guard go down early in the season, each one of us has had to step up to the plate and fill additional roles."

"The language in Senate Bill 152 — part of the Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2012 — also applies the sales tax to electronic versions of newspapers, magazines, online chat rooms and blogs that charge fees.

"Gee, who do you think they're taking with the No. 1 pick April 26?"
"The company and its unions say they are in good-faith negotiations about pension changes, but clearly some reductions are coming and some jobs will be lost. But the unions want investors, creditors and other stakeholders to share the burden. If the bankruptcy court allows the company to dump its pension obligations, the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. would be on the hook (hello, deficits)."

"This new federal tactic targets what skeptics have long said was the soft underbelly of state-level medical pot laws: the fact that ""prescriptions"" can't be filled at a pharmacy. To fill that void, a loose network of growing cooperatives and clubs sprouted in many communities. Some were decidedly casual about whom they served; in response, about a half-dozen states began to regulate the outlets."
"Sone shows a creative California flair with ""Lissa's Staff Meal'' ($18), clearly demonstrating there's much more to sashimi than knowing how to slice raw fish. The chef makes ""noodles'' out of long chewy strips of cuttlefish and mounds them in the center of a burnished origami-like bowl with a julienne of daikon, burdock root stained orange to look like carrots, precise rounds of sliced okra, orange salmon eggs and sea urchin. A quail egg, held upright by a dab of wasabi, is meant to be blended with the fiery condiment, poured over ingredients and tossed. The seductively slick okra, the silky slip of egg and the velvety but chewy texture of the fish play beautifully against the crunch of vegetables. Although there's a lot going on, each flavor is distinctive, revealing a true artistry."
"A bill authorizing two new casinos in Atlantic City was approved by an Assembly panel. It could be voted on by the entire Assembly in about two weeks."
"The state gets a B for finance because of the simplicity of its funding system, though some education leaders would argue it should get a lower grade for the sufficiency of its school support."
"Executing prisoners who ""volunteer"" by declining appeals is actually good policy. Prisoners, properly advised, may competently choose not to exercise constitutional rights. They have not ""volunteered"" for the death penalty, that decision was made by a judge and a jury, based on evidence in a courtroom. In a state where we allow competent patients to choose physician-assisted death, and where we allow citizens to decline life support when facing terminal illnesses, how can we decline similar autonomy to prisoners? The governor is concerned that the system is expensive. But that is the cost of protecting the public interest in assuring publicly provided safeguards. And whether that expense is justified arguably needs to be viewed through the eyes of the victims' families. Perhaps, as well, we might measure cost by comparison to a state retirement system that pays a football coach $500,000 per year."
"""Why clog up the courts with cases that will only make people poorer?"" asked William Cottrell, an attorney who has taught a course on creditor/debtor law at William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul for the past 11 years."
"From time to time during the last two years I heard from well-meaning individuals who suggested that I ought to consider running as an independent. My response was always the same: I am a Republican now and always have been. I have no desire to run as anything else. All my life, I have believed in the Republican principles of small government, low taxes, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and trade expansion. According to Congressional Quarterly vote studies, I supported President Reagan more often than any other Senator. I want to see a Republican elected President, and I want to see a Republican majority in the Congress. I hope my opponent wins in November to help give my friend Mitch McConnell a majority."

"If you're a timid eater, stick with the dumplings, pot stickers and chow mein with shrimp or chicken. You'll still enjoy the flavors and have fun in the space, which features rustic brick inner walls juxtaposed with sleek modern décor."
"""I think that there are marriages that work with people who have very different emotional styles that complement one another - if they can find ways to work together,"" he says. ""For example, if one member of a couple is highly socially intuitive and the other member is not, the highly social one could be the designated member of the pair who enables their social network and who makes social arrangements for the family, whereas the one who's not very socially intuitive takes care of the house, manages their finances and so forth."
"Q. I live in Illinois and regularly attend St. Louis Blues home games. I drive over the Poplar Street Bridge and take the exit ramp to 9th and Clark streets. At the bottom of the ramp is a three-way light that operates on timers and does not have sensors to detect traffic. The green light for traffic on the exit ramp lasts only 15 seconds whereas the green light for traffic on Clark lasts well over a minute. Prior to Blues (and Cardinals) games, traffic backs up on the ramp and requires vehicles to wait for three or four traffic light cycles. These backups occasionally reach all the way to Highway 40 (Interstate 64), which creates a severe safety risk. I believe the city needs to put in traffic sensors at the three-way intersection which would extend the length of time for the green light for vehicles on the ramp, thus improving safety and increasing traffic flow efficiency."

"By the time the stage-hands finished powdering David Lee Roth's parquet dance mats, the Verizon Center started to look a little more like the sold-out venue it was. Beer salesmen moved fast. Spirits were high. When Van Halen opened with “Unchained,” I was surprised that the mostly-male audience on the floor did not riot and start throwing folding chairs, presumably because it is difficult to riot when both of your hands are gripping $8 Miller Lites."

Chesterton is delightful. I assign that word not only to his writing, but to the man himself. He was clumsy and almost pathologically absent-minded. At 6'4"" and almost 300 pounds he was a conspicuous figure, but seemed to determined to be more conspicuous still. He usually wore a cape and crumpled hat, and carried a swordstick in hand. G.K.

Now, thanks to craft distillers, the water of life can come in many flavors, proofs, bottles and barrels - and even frozen. Here's a round of sites for experiencing the spirit's true spirit."

That's a fundamental thing I'd like them to understand, not just a way of making a living or a lot of name, but go deep into music and keep it alive. To keep an age-old culture with its depth, its feeling, its whole aspect is not very easy. Because now especially the world has become so commercial — it is do it now as soon as you can, make a name, make a record. So whether it is classical Western or Indian, I think it has the same problem. It's hard in these modern days to have students who have the love and respect for the tradition."

They were even selected to represent Ireland at the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest, with one of the catchiest songs I've heard in awhile, ""Lipstick."" Once again, the vocals were horrible, but something about the whole stage performance got Europe to vote for Jedward, once again proving that just because you can't sing doesn't mean you don't have the X Factor."

Culture will play a central role in European life for the foreseeable future. But how much of it should be financed by the government? That's a question being asked in many European capitals as budgets are being tightened.

Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the title piece, at 85 pages more novella than short story, which revolves around Alma, an older woman in the middle stages of dementia who is an outpatient in an experimental memory clinic in Cape Town, South Africa.

So if you're only running about two weeks, you're just about making your advertising back. The economic underpinnings of the independent-movie business have kind of just eroded.

To protect a sweetheart deal for a small group of irrigators, the settlement attempts to perpetuate commercial leaseland farming on 22,000 acres of Tule Lake and Lower Klamath refuges and asks taxpayers to subsidize this harmful practice. In contrast, phasing out this federally managed program, using those lands to store winter water, and using the 1905 priority date water rights associated with those lands for fish and wildlife purposes would represent a huge step toward a sustainable Klamath Basin -- at a fraction of the cost of the settlement deal."

Yet there are no contrivances here: no custom-ground meat blends, no willful denial of ketchup and no flavors fortified by what might otherwise amount to a chemistry experiment. Instead, the restaurant's signature burger is a tender, hand-formed turkey patty, a crispy lattice of turkey bacon, a firmly fried egg, a single slice of cheese, sweet mashed yams and wilted collard greens on a gently toasted sesame-seed bun. It's a triumph of maximalism, a burger in expert balance despite its seeming overabundance of ingredients."

Upon hearing this, many middle-aged and older people begin telling me about the drugs they take. Often, the person inadvertently tells me a lot more about their medical history than they intended, because I know why each of their drugs is prescribed. A few times, people have even confided in me that they take a lower dose than their doctor told them to, or they don't always pick up drugs their doctor calls in. How do I get myself out of these conversations so that I can enjoy a party? And how do I explain that these are conversations they should be having with their doctor (about not taking the correct dosage, or not taking drugs prescribed to them), and not with a new acquaintance at a party? — Cornered"

"UO defense vs. Nevada offense: Here is where Nevada could fall off dramatically from last season. The Wolf Pack, operating the Pistol Offense invented by coach Chris Ault, averaged 41 points per game while going 13-1 in 2010. That came after leading the nation in rushing with 345 yards per game in 2009. The offense befuddled California last season when the Wolf Pack defeated the Pac-12 team, 52-31 at home. The problem for Nevada is that those numbers were put up with quarterback Colin Kaepernick and running back Vai Taua in the backfield. Both are now in the NFL. They accounted for 2,836 yards rushing and 39 touchdowns last season. Kaepernick also passed for 3,022 yards and 22 touchdowns. Stepping in at quarterback is fifth-year senior Tyler Lantrip, who has thrown 23 passes in his career. Oregon's defense stood strong against LSU despite being placed in unenviable situations.

Households have more smartphones than they have TV sets, typically. And they replace their handsets at a more rapid rate.

"The pretty Hampshire village is where Austen was born in the rectory of her father's church in 1775. Like many places that have an early connection with a famous person's life, Steventon has less to offer the fan than hoped. It was the incubator of Austen's talents, but her literary life really started after she left town. The 13th century St. Nicholas church where her father was vicar still stands, though the rectory was torn down in 1828. The church bells are a 1995 gift from the Jane Austen Society of North America. Life in the small village shaped her country-centric attitudes. The Vyne, a great house in nearby Basingstoke that is now maintained by the National Trust, was the scene of the kind of parties that populate her books. Austen's father's decision to retire from the church and move in 1801 to the busy, expensive city of Bath came as culture shock to Austen, then 26. In what may be an apocryphally melodramatic story, Jane is said to have fainted dead away when her father broke what he thought was the happy news."

"The thing is, Ichiro Suzuki might be the most underappreciated great player of his generation. Part of this is he’s been stuck on a losing team most of his career. Part of this is because he’s Japanese; on our field of dreams, we prefer homegrown athletic superstars. Part of this is he’s playing in the Pacific Northwest; many Americans couldn’t locate the Pacific Northwest on a U.S. map, and most Mariners games end about the time Carson Daly is interviewing some indie actress I’ve never heard of."

P&G's rival Kimberly-Clark said last week that higher prices helped boost its quarterly earnings 34 percent. But results for P&G, which has an arsenal of products that include Tide detergent and Olay skin cream, illustrate that even big companies that sell trusted brands can lose customers to lower-priced rivals when they raise prices."
"Historically, New York restaurants did have communal tables. “Even the tony Rotunda at the Astor House was communal dining,” William Grimes, the author of “Appetite City: A Culinary History of New York,” says of the favorite luncheon spot for the city’s gentlemen in the late 1800s. As more restaurants opened, he says, “eating at your own table became the norm.”"

"With a progressive tax system -- supposedly requiring the rich to pay more of their income than the poor -- it's indefensible that some wealthy people enjoy preferential treatment. It subverts any sense of fairness. And raising the top rate wouldn't much hurt the economy if the rate isn't punitive. To me, 30 percent seems reasonable.

"Let's give Cameron some credit though. Maybe it was ingenuity, or maybe it was desperation, but either way, his decision to put Flacco in the shotgun and make him hustle the offense to the line of scrimmage changed everything about this game. It slowed Arizona's pass rush, it gave Flacco a boost of confidence, and raised the energy level of the entire offense."

"We came up short, but I dont think we lost. I think they just beat us, Self said. Davis realized early this was no shoot-first night for him at the Superdome. Sporting his near-unibrow, which the UK Wildcat mascot also decided to paste on, he endured the worst shooting night of a short college career in which he makes 64 percent. No big deal. He set the tone early on defense, swatting Robinsons shot twice, grabbing rebounds, making pretty bounce passes for assists."
"In at least one past instance, the Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for an attack it played no role in. Mehsud reportedly said his men were behind a mass shooting in March 2009 at the American Civic Association in Binghamton, N.Y., in April 2009. That claim turned out to be false."

"Worries over the radical fringe have risen at a time when tensions are growing between the generals who succeeded Mubarak and other Islamists over a host of issues — including the fate of the military-backed government, a court case looking into the legitimacy of the Islamist-dominated parliament and the selection process for a 100-member panel that will draft a new constitution."
"Up front: The Hawks are simply deeper and more talented. There isn't much there for the Coyotes behind the ageless Ray Whitney, Radim Vrbata and Shane Doan, but they can make the Hawks pay for their errors. Vrbata (35 goals) has a tendency to score big and frustrating goals against his former team."

Several glasses into our tasting of ""buttery"" Chardonnays and ""ashy"" Pinots, Alfaro fired up his Kawasaki mule, an all-terrain vehicle, to give us a closer look at his vines. But first he adjusted his headband to keep his long, cool-dad hair from whipping him in the face. ""This is our Pinot,"" he shouted over his shoulder as we charged over the crest of a hill and into a valley with rows of dormant vines. Alfaro cut the engine and dismounted next to a pile of vine shoots. It was the remnants of pruning season. ""This whole area is perfect for Pinot because there are lots of warm days and cold nights,"" he said."

"Most oil-packed tuna in the U.S. is packed in soybean oil. Going back a few decades, somebody whispered to someone else that oil adds unnecessary fat and calories, so many people choose tuna in water.

"The folks at HTC are probably still celebrating so let's just be quiet here while we talk about how silly those numbers are. The beauty of the Windows Phone OS is that it's a clean, uncluttered, and elegant design. Unlike an Android phone, a Windows Phone doesn't need a lot of real estate. So if anything, a large screen is a disadvantage; it makes it hard for people with smaller hands (like, I dunno . . . women) to operate the Titan.

It’s also not worth ignoring the potential that we saw the year before. Even by the end of the season we saw his return to form, at least against the Ravens in Week 16. With a full recovery and without the target on his back coming from the Madden cover, I still think Hillis can be the running back that the Browns' offense needs him to be.

There's much to do -- or not do -- here for couples seeking some down time. Open daily, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission starts at $35 per person; $48 on weekends and holidays.

But I did; I thought I'd found a way to hide it beneath the collar of my shirt."
"For fans of aerial displays, this spring game hit the mark. The two quarterbacks combined to complete 40 of 55 passes for 443 yards (Miller was 24 of 31 for 258; Guiton 16 of 24 for 185), and each threw an interception. And get this: Meyer thought both could have been sharper. He wants Miller to be more accurate. And Guiton’s interception, which came on a fourth-quarter drive that could have given the Gray the lead, was the result of being late, which Meyer said is Guiton’s primary problem. Both worked from four- and five-wide sets most of the day, and threw from the pocket, on the rollout or scrambling, while operating a no-huddle, up-tempo offense. It featured myriad crossing patterns, including the lone TD pass, from Guiton to Devin Smith on a deep route that set Smith free to catch and run."

That means a smaller dose of L-methylfolate may be able to exert the same effect as a much larger dose of folate. (Mischoulon is conducting a clinical trial of a commercial form of L-methylfolate called Deplin; the trial is supported by Pamlab, Deplin's maker.)"

"Third, some House leaders want to begin laying the foundation for entitlement reform, since large, unfunded entitlement commitments are the main cause of the American fiscal crisis. But this approach splits the Republican conference, with some members asserting it is premature and politically damaging. Even supporters of raising the issue think in incremental terms. While America may have the Greek economic disease, the worst symptoms are not immediate. ""We are not at the austerity stage yet,"" one House member told me. ""We still have time to change on our own terms."" The hope of entitlement-reform advocates is to spend two years preparing the public -- demonstrating that scaling back benefits is possible without removing the safety net, building alliances with centrist Democrats and ensuring that the 2012 Republican presidential candidate is supportive."
